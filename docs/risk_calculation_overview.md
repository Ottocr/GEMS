# Understanding GEMS Risk Calculations: A Client Overview

## Introduction

The Global Enterprise Monitoring System (GEMS) uses a sophisticated yet intuitive approach to calculate risk levels for your assets worldwide. This document explains how GEMS evaluates risks and helps you make informed security decisions.

## The Swiss Cheese Model

GEMS uses the internationally recognized "Swiss Cheese" model of risk management, where:
- Each security barrier acts as a layer of protection
- No single barrier is perfect (hence the "holes" in the cheese)
- Multiple layers work together to reduce overall risk
- The effectiveness of each layer is scientifically measured

## How GEMS Calculates Risk

### 1. Understanding Your Assets
GEMS evaluates each asset based on:
- **Criticality**: How important the asset is to your operations
- **Vulnerability**: How susceptible the asset is to threats
- **Location**: Where the asset is and what regional risks it faces

### 2. Evaluating Security Barriers
Each security measure (barrier) is assessed on five key aspects:
- **Prevention** (30%): How well it stops threats
- **Detection** (20%): How well it identifies threats
- **Response** (20%): How well it handles detected threats
- **Reliability** (15%): How consistently it performs
- **Coverage** (15%): How comprehensively it protects

For example, a perimeter fence might score:
```
Prevention: 8/10
Detection: 7/10
Response: 7/10
Reliability: 8/10
Coverage: 8/10
Overall Effectiveness: 7.6/10
```

### 3. Assessing Scenarios
GEMS evaluates specific risk scenarios by considering:
- **Likelihood**: How probable the scenario is
- **Impact**: What damage it could cause
- **Vulnerability**: How exposed the asset is
- **Barrier Effectiveness**: How well protections work

### 4. Regional Factors
The system includes:
- Country-specific threat levels
- Regional security considerations
- Local risk factors

## Risk Levels Explained

GEMS uses four risk levels:

ðŸŸ¢ **LOW** (1-3)
- Well-protected assets
- Effective barriers in place
- Low regional threats

ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM** (3-5)
- Generally protected assets
- Some improvements possible
- Moderate regional threats

ðŸŸ  **HIGH** (5-8)
- Significant vulnerabilities
- Barrier improvements needed
- Elevated regional threats

ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** (8-10)
- Immediate attention required
- Major vulnerabilities present
- High regional threats

## Real-World Example

Consider a corporate office:

1. **Asset Assessment**
   - Criticality: 8/10 (Key operations center)
   - Vulnerability: 5/10 (Standard office building)

2. **Security Barriers**
   - Physical barriers (fences, gates)
   - Access control systems
   - Security personnel
   - Cyber security measures

3. **Risk Scenarios**
   - Break-in attempt
   - Cyber attack
   - Natural disaster
   - Civil unrest

4. **Final Risk Score**
   The system combines all these factors to produce:
   - Individual scenario risks
   - Overall asset risk level
   - Recommended improvements

## How to Use This Information
